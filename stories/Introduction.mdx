# Introduction

To get started, let's first take a look at the suggested file structure:

<Source
  code={[
    `src/`,
    `  Component.mjs // The actual component`,
    ``,
    `stories/`,
    `  Component.mdx // Docs page for the component stories (optional)`,
    `  Component.example.mjs // An example of how to implement the component`,
    `  Component.stories.mjs // Stories of the component`,
  ].join('\n')}
/>

Using a separate file for each implementation "example component" allows us to:

- Add state functionality (as you would in a real implementation).
- Define a variety of prop combinations.
- Import the functional example as the rendered component of a story.
- Import the file as raw source code (with some [Webpack](https://idesigncode-storybook-tools.netlify.app/?path=/docs/configuration-webpack--docs) configuration).

Of course the file names and locations are just a suggestion - they are not required.

## Components

All components are designed to be used within [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) or directly in [Docs pages](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/mdx).

- [DefaultValue](/docs/components-propstable--docs) - a table detailing a single prop's default value.
- [PropsTable](/docs/components-propstable--docs) - automatically document static & "live-updating" props details.
- [Source](/docs/components-source--docs) - display a block of source code.

These components are also compatible with [User Interaction](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing), [DOM](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) & [Image](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot) Snapshot tests.

## Configuration

The default themes and component styles can be imported with the [default CSS styles](https://idesigncode-storybook-tools.netlify.app/?path=/docs/configuration-css--docs).

If are using Docs pages, you might also want to enable the light & dark mode theme functionality with the [DocsContainer](https://idesigncode-storybook-tools.netlify.app/?path=/docs/configuration-docscontainer--docs).

Optionally, some further configuration is required for some of the more advanced functionality:

- [Webpack](https://idesigncode-storybook-tools.netlify.app/?path=/docs/configuration-webpack--docs) - enables the "raw imports" and "unminified display of props" functionality.
- [Import Path Replacements](/docs/configuration-import-path-replacements--docs) - enables transforming file import paths displayed by the Source component.
