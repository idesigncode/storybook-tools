# Source

Adds a block of source code with "copy" functionality to the page.

Similar to [Storybook's Source block](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/doc-block-source) but with code replacement functionality for production-ready source code and image snapshot testing compatibility.

<Story of={SourceStories.Props} />

### Implementation:

To render a source code block provide any string as `code`:

<Story of={SourceStories.Code} />

The default theme is set with the `useDarkMode` hook from [storybook-dark-mode](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/storybook-dark-mode), but this can be overwritten with the boolean `dark`:

<Story of={SourceStories.Dark} />

> #### Note:
>
> - As `Source` is designed to show production-ready source code, it will automatically remove any use of [PropsTable](/docs/components-propstable--docs).
> - This can be disabled by setting `removePropsTable` to `false`.

### Import Path Replacement (optional):

The `Source` component can also display all relative [file import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) paths as they would be used by a consumer of your code.

By default, this functionality is disabled unless `process.env.PACKAGE_NAME` has a value.

You can also disable import path replacements on each instance of `Source` by setting `importPathReplacer` to `false` or an empty string.

To use import path replacements, set `process.env.PACKAGE_NAME` with [Storybook environment variables](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/environment-variables#using-storybook-configuration):

<Story of={SourceStories.Env} />

Alternatively you can supply your own string for `importPathReplacer` directly on each instance of `Source`.

For further control, you can also use the inline comment `// preserve-path` to opt-out of the import path replacement:

<Story of={SourceStories.Component} />

<Story of={SourceStories.ComponentRaw} />

<Story of={SourceStories.ComponentRawDisplayedSource} />

> #### Note:
>
> - Any use of the `// preserve-path` will be removed from the displayed source code if `importPathReplacer` has a non-empty string value.
>
> #### See also:
>
> - [Raw Imports](/docs/configuration-raw-imports--docs) - get the source code of an imported file.
