# Import Path Replacements (optional):

The [Source](/docs/components-source--docs) component can automatically display all [file import paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) as they would be used by a consumer of your code.

By default, this functionality is disabled unless `process.env.IMPORT_PATH_REPLACEMENTS` has a value - a stringified "key-value pair" object:

- `[key]` - a string to match within an import path (also accepts `^` to prepend relative paths).
- `[value]` - a string to replace the matched `[key]` string.

> #### Note:
>
> - Import path replacements are performed in the order specified.
> - Matches may occur more than once within an import path.

To use import path replacements globally, you can add the configuration to an `.env` file or with [Storybook environment variables](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/environment-variables#using-storybook-configuration):

<Story of={ImportPathReplacementsStories.Env} />
