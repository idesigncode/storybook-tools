# Webpack

Certain Webpack configuration settings are required for correct functionality of some components and features.

These can be easily added to `.storybook/main.mjs` with the named export `webpackFinal`:

<Story of={WebpackStories.Implementation} />

  <details>
    <summary>
      <p>Using `webpackFinal` with custom configuration settings</p>
    </summary>

You can alternatively use the imported `webpackFinal` async function with your own custom configuration settings:

<Story of={WebpackStories.ImplementationCustomSettings} />

</details>

The imported `webpackFinal` async function will set the following configuration:

<Story of={WebpackStories.WebpackFinalConfig} />

### Raw Imports

Once Webpack is configured, you can import the raw source code of any file with the `?raw` import suffix (a.k.a. "Webpack resource query"):

<Story of={WebpackStories.RawImport} />
