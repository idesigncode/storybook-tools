# Raw Imports

To document the source code of any file you can use the `?raw` import suffix (a.k.a. "webpack resource query"):

<Story of={RawImportsStories.Example} />

To use the `?raw` import suffix, the following configuration must be added to `./storybook/main.mjs`:

<Story of={RawImportsStories.WebpackFinalRulesConfig} />
